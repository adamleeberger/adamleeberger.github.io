        <li />Give 2 examples of payors in the healthcare ecosystem

        <li />What's the difference between a premium and a co-pay. In each case, who pays and who receives the payment?

        <li />What is the problem that co-pays are designed to address?

        <li />How does the term 'moral hazard' relate to healthcare?

        ("Biases in electronic health record data...")

        <li />The paper describes a study that compares two different kinds of data to predict 3-year survival. What are
        those two different kinds of data? Describe the experimental setup.

        <li />Figure 3b shows that patients tested at 4 am with normal white blood cell count values have lower survival
        (85.4%) than patients tested at 4 pm with either abnormally low (93.0%, P
        <0.001) or high (91.4%, P<0.001) values. Using the same figure, can you draw an analogous conclusion about
            patients who are tested at various frequencies (e.g. 1 hour vs 1 year) after a previous white blood cell
            test? 
            
        <li /> The paper details several cases where healthcare processes create bias in a healthcare data
        record. Can you think of a scenario where one might draw dangerously wrong conclusions from this biased data?
        Can you think of a scenario where using this biased data can be helpful?

        <li/>What are the benefits of a parsimonious model?  What is a key disadvantage?
        <li/>The paper uses only data sourced from a health insurance company (Blue Cross Independence of PA). Thje study did not use data from any hospital or clinic. What are some advantages they cite for this approach? Can you think of any drawbacks?
        <li/>How do the authors assert that a higher-accuracy predictive algorithm would benefit the DPP?
        <li/>The paper relies on a L1-regularized logistic regression model for predicting diabetes. In the discussion, they mention (without detail) that this approach was as good or better than other model forms, e.g. random forests and neural networks. Even assuming all the models had equivalent performance, why might you prefer a logistic regression model here?
