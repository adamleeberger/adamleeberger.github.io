    <p><strong>DRAFT</strong></p>
    <p>A graduate-level course offered in the CMU Machine Learning Department.</p>
    <h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
    <p>Machine learning (ML) is experiencing explosive growth in healthcare, and is now top of mind for leaders at
        hospitals, insurance companies, and pharmaceutical firms.</p>
    <p>This course offers a survey of ML in healthcare today. Students will gain firsthand experience working with
        electronic health records, time-series medical data, and other healthcare data sources. The course will cover
        how ML (and AI more generally) is impacting healthcare financing, operations, and care delivery, e.g. in
        radiology, pathology, and ophthalmology. Students will learn how to apply causal inference, anomaly detection,
        Bayesian statistics, natural language processing, and large language models to important problems in healthcare,
        such as predicting the future condition of a patient, and forecasting how long a patient will remain in the
        hospital. The course will address the challenges of working responsibly with healthcare data, including
        potential biases and inconsistencies, and provide strategies for identifying and mitigating these issues.</p>
    <p>The class is open to graduate students in SCS. It is also open to qualified, motivated undergraduates from all
        majors in SCS, and to students with interest and sufficient expertise in other CMU colleges. The course assumes
        a strong competency in Python/pandas/jupyter, and hands-on experience building models (xgboost, logistic
        regression, neural networks). No background in healthcare is expected.</p>
    <p>The course consists of 2x/week 90-minute lectures, problem sets, and a final project. There will be no exams.</p>
