                <h1>Course Overview</h1>

                <p>Machine learning (ML) is experiencing explosive growth in healthcare, and is now top of mind for
                    leaders at
                    hospitals, insurance companies, and pharmaceutical firms. This course offers a survey of ML in
                    healthcare today.
                    Students will gain firsthand experience working with
                    electronic health records, time-series medical data, health insurance ("administrative") data, and
                    many
                    other healthcare data sources. The course
                    will cover
                    how ML (and AI more generally) is impacting healthcare financing, operations, and care delivery,
                    with
                    select 'deep dives' into radiology, pathology, and ophthalmology. Students will learn how to apply
                    ML methods to
                    important problems in healthcare,
                    such as predicting disease onset and forecasting how long a patient will remain
                    in the
                    hospital. The course will address the challenges of working responsibly with healthcare data,
                    including
                    potential biases and inconsistencies and confounders, and provide strategies for identifying and
                    mitigating these
                    issues.</p>
                <p>The class is open to graduate students in SCS. It is also open to qualified, motivated undergraduates
                    from all
                    majors in SCS, and to students with interest and sufficient expertise in other CMU colleges. The
                    course assumes
                    a strong competency in Python/pandas/jupyter, and hands-on experience building models such as
                    xgboost,
                    logistic
                    regression, neural networks. It also requires a mathematical maturity that includes college-level probability, statistics, and discrete math. 
                    No background in healthcare is expected.</p>
                <p>The course consists of twice weekly lectures with assigned readings, problem sets, and a final
                    project. There will be no
                    exams.</p>

                                There are many unmet needs in the practice of pathology, like workload increase and workforce shortage, that could 
                                potentially be solved by leveraging AI/ML. The aim of this talk is to review the different applications of traditional 
                                and generative AI in pathology. The impact of pre-imaging factors, business use case in different practice 
                                settings, prerequisites for deployment, and method for clinical validation of AI will also be discussed.

                <b>Attendance</b>

                <p>We expect that students will attend class in person. We do not support remote participation in
                    lectures
                    and will
                    not make recordings available. In an age of virtual / asynchronous learning, this may seem
                    retrograde.
                    But
                    there’s a good reason we insist on in-person participation. Pittsburgh is the epicenter of health
                    technology
                    research, and we’ve managed to convince some of the leading minds in healthcare/AI to deliver
                    lectures
                    on their
                    topics of expertise. We can&apos;t have them presenting to an empty lecture hall. We will take
                    attendance at all
                    lectures, and attendance at lectures is an important ingredient in
                    your
                    final
                    course grade. We understand that people have high-priority conflicts and get ill, and in recognition of that, we
                    consider four 
                    absences equivalent to full attendance.</p>

                <b>Collaboration and Use of Third Party Tools/Libraries/Repos</b>

                <p>For the assignments – including the final project, you are welcome to use any generative AI tool to
                    generate or
                    check your source code or accompanying text. You are also welcome to fork an existing github repo,
                    so
                    long as
                    that repo does not belong to a fellow class member or a student from a previous version of this
                    class.
                    Having
                    said that, any work you turn in is your responsibility. Know that you will learn much more from
                    working
                    through
                    any problem than from copying its answer from a tool or other source. Much good can come from using
                    generative
                    AI, but much risk arises when you adopt the output of such a tool without completely understanding
                    it.</p>

                <p>You may work alone or in groups for the assignments. Each student must write up and
                    turn in
                    their own assignment. On every assignment, you must identify your collaborators. If you did not
                    discuss
                    the
                    problem set with anyone, you should write “Collaborators: none." You must acknowledge all sources
                    (e.g.
                    Wikipedia, a website, a genAI tool) in your assignment. It is a violation of this policy to submit a
                    problem
                    solution that you cannot orally explain to a member of the course staff. Plagiarism and other
                    dishonest
                    behavior
                    cannot be tolerated in any academic environment. If you have any questions about the collaboration
                    policy, or if
                    you feel that you may have violated the policy, please talk to one of the course staff.</p>
                </p>

                <p>For the final project, you may work alone or in groups of two students at most. Groups should create
                    a
                    single
                    poster/writeup.</p>

                <b>Late Policy</b>

                <p>This course&apos;s late policy is simple: hand in all your assignments on time.  There is no 
                    grace period for submitting answers to the prerequisite readings for each lecture; the entire   
                    purpose of those questions is to get you prepared for the lecture so you can get the most out of it. For the problem sets,  
                    we allow submissions up to two days after the due date, with a penalty of 25% of the total points available for one day late and 50% for two days late. We won't accept 
                    submissions more than 48 hours after the deadline, since that's when we'll start grading the assignments. 
                    You will receive zero credit for submitting the final project proposal or final project itself after the deadline.</p> 


                <b>Pedagogical Sequencing</b>
                <p>We are intentionally front-loading the problem sets in the semester so that you can focus on your
                    final
                    projects
                    in the second half of the semester, which means that some course material will appear in a problem
                    set
                    before it
                    is presented in a lecture. That is a feature, not a bug. Especially when we expect you are seeing
                    material for
                    the first time, we will make every effort to explain the material carefully and completely in the
                    problem set.
                </p>

                <b>Pass-Fail</b>
                <p>You are allowed to take this course as Pass/Fail; instructor permission is not required. What letter
                    grade
                    is the cutoff for a Pass will depend on your specific program; we do not specify whether or not you
                    pass but
                    rather we compute your letter grade the same as everyone else in the class and your program converts
                    that
                    letter grade to a Pass or Fail depending on their cutoff. Be sure to check with your
                    program/department as
                    to whether you can count a Pass/Fail course towards your degree requirements.
                </p>

                <b>Reasonable Person Principle</b>

                <p>The course staff subscribes the the ancient CMU <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~weigand/staff/">Reasonable Person Principle</a>
                and we will strive to accomodate 
                students who face exceptional circumstances during the semester. Our overriding goal is that students
                learn, find themselves challenged, and grow into ML+Healthcare practitioners. The lectures, problem sets, 
                readings, final project, and grades are all a means to that end. 
            </p>
                <div id="Grading">
                    <h1>Grading</h1>

                    <p>We will calculate your final grade using the following weighting:</p>

                    <li />Problem sets (5 total): 35 points (point allocation marked on each problem set)
                    <li />Final project proposal (Milestone 1): 3 points
                    <li/> Final project progress report (Milestone 2): 3 points
                    <li/>Final project (poster and live presentation): 19 points 
                    <li />Answers to reading assignments: 10 points
                    <li />Attendance at lectures: 20 points
                    <li />Participation: 10 points

                    <div id="Project">
                        <h1>Final Project</h1>


                        <p>The final project is an opportunity to follow your curiosity, go deep in a particular
                            healthcare domain
                            and
                            dataset, and build something interesting.

                            You are responsible for coming up with a project idea and delivering a 1-page proposal to
                            the course
                            staff by
                            Milestone 1 (see below), and iterating on the proposal until you receive approval from the
                            instructor.
                            You will
                            then implement the project and present it to the course staff and a broader CMU audience in
                            a public
                            poster
                            session, similar to what you would experience at an academic conference.</p>

                        <p>It is NOT required that you develop something novel and publishable. A perfectly acceptable,
                            full-credit
                            final
                            project would be to replicate (perhaps with your own twists) an existing result from the
                            literature.

                            Before submitting your proposal to the course staff, be sure to ask yourself these
                            questions:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li />Does this project address a meaningful problem in healthcare? (The first third of the
                            course will
                            help you make an informed assessment.)
                            <li />Does this project rely on machine learning (supervised, unsupervised), or RL)? Healthcare
                            analytics
                            projects are
                            important and interesting, but this is an ML class.
                            <li /> Does this project leverage a healthcare dataset?
                        </ol>

                        While we don't want to be overly-prescriptive about the project writeup,
                        you will want to include at least some of the typical elements of most papers published in the
                        last five years in the
                        area of machine learning in healthcare, such as:

                        <ul>
                            <li />EDA (exploratory data analysis)
                            <li />Pointer to source code (for reproducibility)
                            <li />Why you selected the model form you did.
                            <li />Some details on model building: train/test split, approach to smoothing, number of
                            iterations, etc.
                            <li />Where and how your work fits relative to the academic literature
                            <li /> Shortcomings of your work
                        </ul>

                                <li /><b>Question answering (Q/A) on EMRs</b>: The typical EMR patient record contains a
                                vast amount of
                                information,
                                especially for older patients with chronic diseases. A high-quality Q/A system can allow
                                physicians to
                                to

                                of
                                manually searching through pages and pages of information. Use a base model like

                                embedding model
                                for patients. Can you build a high-performing parsimious embedding model? By
                                'parsimonious', here we mean that the
                                embedding only relies on a very small set of features, which makes the embedding model
                                easier to adopt.


                                <li /><b>Quality of care assessment</b>: Use CMS data to build a model that predicts the

                                provided by
                                healthcare providers and institutions. (You will need to define ‘quality’). You may wish
                                to look at
                                datasets

                                satisfaction data. What
                                features
                                are most associated with high-quality care?

                                <li /><b>Multimodal AI</b>: There are more and more public multimodal healthcare
                                datasets becoming
                                available,
                                consisting of (for example) images and associated metadata. One example is the ISIC
                                dataset of skin
                                lesions, which contains images of skin lesions along with corresponding clinical
                                information, such as
                                lesion location, patient demographics, and textual descriptions. Use a pre-trained
                                convolutional neural network
                                (CNN) model, such as ResNet,, to extract visual features from the dermatoscopic images.
                                In parallel, use a
                                pre-trained language model, such as BERT or BioBERT, to extract textual features from
                                the clinical notes. Explore
                                different techniques for fusing the visual and textual features. Report on the models’
                                performance on a test set.
                                Use a tool like grad-CAM to generate heatmaps to show which parts of an image are most
                                influencing the model.

                        Some of these datasets may require paperwork/approval to get access, so plan ahead. <br /><br />

                        <b>Milestones</b>

                        <p>The Final Project will have three milestones during the semester:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li />Milestone 1 (Oct 10): Submit project proposal, which includes the dataset, the problem you are addressing, and a brief outline of your approach.
                            <li />Milestone 2 (Nov 7): Submit 1-page progress report, describing work completed and pending
                            <li />Milestone 3 (Dec 3): Poster session / live demo. Submit your poster as a pdf within Canvas before the poster session.

                            <p>This course derives inspiration from MIT 6.7930, a course in machine learning that MIT
                                has offered since
                                2017. To
                                our knowledge, that course is the first and (until now) only course on ML+Healthcare
                                offered for credit
                                to
                                students at any US university. MIT has kindly put the 6.7930 course material under their
                                OCW (open coursework) license, and we
                                have drawn
                                selectively from that material in constructing lectures and problem sets for this
                                course. We thank
                                Professors
                                Peter Szolovits and David Sontag for their permission---granted directly and through OCW---to
                                adapt the 6.7930 material for
                                this course. Any errors in this (CMU) course material is, of course, the responsibility
                                of the
                                instructor and not anyone else.</p>

                            (BOTTOM OF FILE)
